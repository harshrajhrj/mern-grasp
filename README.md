# mern-grasp
This repository includes my all learning path regarding MERN stack. I've segregated my learning implementation and outcomes in different branches known by the name of the branch itself.

## Detailed documentation will be written soon
### What to change?
* Instead of using [`Axios`](https://github.com/harshrajhrj/mern-grasp/blob/b603c127baf596ffcf127129db0703a64cc6465a/client/src/App.js#L15), I will be using in-built [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API.
