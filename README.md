# mern-grasp
This repository includes my all learning path regarding MERN stack. I've segregated my learning implementation and outcomes in different branches known by the name of the branch itself.

## Detailed documentation will be written soon
### What to change?
* Instead of using [`Axios`](https://github.com/harshrajhrj/mern-grasp/blob/85c605a5dc06abcedd2d7c59f0de9fb8d9029a0b/client/src/App.js#L15), I will be using in-built [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API.
